# Unit 4 Crystal Collector Game

## About 
This is a simple crystal collector game with a Destiny theme! Each of the four crystals, or engrams in this case, will be assigned a random value. The values of these crystals will be added to the total each time one is clicked.  

## How to Play:
You will try to match the random number that is generated each time a new game starts. You can achieve this by clicking on each of the four engrams on the page. Each will have a random value that will also change each new game. Your job is to determine the value of each engram and be able to match the random number by adding the values of the engrams. If your total score matches the random number, you win! If you go over the random number you will lose.

I had a difficult time getting the game to reset when the user had either won or lost. I worked through my code and made revisions and eventually got it to work.
